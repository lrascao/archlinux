# As you saw earlier, tmux uses CTRL-b as its command prefix.
# Many tmux users started out using GNU-Screen, which uses CTRL-a for its command prefix.
# CTRL-a is an excellent choice for a prefix because it’s easier to trigger, especially if
# you’ve remapped your computer’s CAPS LOCK key to CTRL as explained in Remapping the
# Caps Lock Key, on page 16. This keeps your hands on the home row of your keyboard.
# To set options in the .tmux.conf file, we use the set-option command, which we can shorten
# to set. Let’s redefine our tmux prefix by adding this code to our .tmux.conf file:
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b

# We’ve remapped CTRL-a as our Prefix, but programs such as Vim, Emacs, and even the
# regular Bash shell also use that combination. We need to configure tmux to let us
# send that command through when we need it. We can do that by binding the send-prefix
# command to a keystroke, like this:
bind C-a send-prefix

# tmux adds a very small delay when sending commands, and this delay can interfere with
# other programs such as the Vim text editor. We can set this delay so it’s much more
# responsive:
set -sg escape-time 1

# This index starts at zero, which can be a little awkward.
# By adding this line to our configuration file:
set -g base-index 0
setw -g pane-base-index 0

# For our first keybinding, we’ll set PREFIX r so it reloads our main
# .tmux.conf file in the current session.
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Configuration reloaded."

# The default keys for splitting panes can be difficult to remember, so let’s set
# our own keys that we won’t be able to forget. We’ll set the horizontal split to
# PREFIX | and the vertical split to PREFIX -.
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# Moving from pane to pane with PREFIX o is a little cumbersome, and using the arrow
# keys means we have to take our fingers off the home row. If you use the Vim text editor,
# you’re probably familiar with its use of h, j, k, and l for movement keys. We can
# remap the movement keys in tmux to these same keys.
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# In addition, we can use PREFIX CTRL-h and PREFIX CTRL-l to cycle through the windows
# by binding those keystrokes to the respective commands:
bind -r C-h select-window -t :-
bind -r C-l select-window -t :+

# Let’s use a variation of the Vim movement keys to resize windows.
# We’ll use PREFIX H, PREFIX J, PREFIX K, and PREFIX L to change the size of the panes:
bind -r H resize-pane -L 5
bind -r J resize-pane -D 5
bind -r K resize-pane -U 5
bind -r L resize-pane -R 5

# There is now a single option that enables mouse mode

# Visual stylings
# --------------------

# We want to make it more apparent which window is active, so we’ll style the active
# window red and the inactive windows cyan. To style the regular win- dows, we use
# set-window-option, like this:
setw -g window-status-style fg=black
setw -g window-status-style bg=default
setw -g window-status-style dim

# We can use default for a value so it inherits from the color of the status bar.
# To style the active window, we use a similar set of options:
setw -g window-status-current-style fg=white
setw -g window-status-current-style bg=white
setw -g window-status-current-style bright

# Center the window list
set -g status-justify centre

# Enable vi keys
setw -g mode-keys vi
set -g status-keys vi
